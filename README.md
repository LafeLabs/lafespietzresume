### Mission

My mission is to work as an applied scientist and teacher toward the global goal of abolishing all mining and petrochemical extraction by 2050.  

### SUMMARY:  

I am an experienced technologist looking to take a leadership role in building curriculum to teach people how to construct the technology humanity will need moving into the post-oil, post-consumer age using open source hardware and software.  I have dedicated much of my life to developing technology in the Public Domain for the common good and sharing the sharing that technology with people of all ages.  I have experience with product development from concept through commercial product in multiple fields, and am interested in sharing that skill set with as wide a range of people as possible.  I have worked on startups as a founder, as a consultant, for large companies, government, and academia and I believe none of he existing institutions are structured in a way which is adequate for the technological revolution required to build a sustainable future.  I believe the way forward is to work in STEAM education to teach young people(k12, undergraduate and graduate) the skills they need to build the institutions which do not yet exist which will solve these problems.  I am willing to work in any sector of the economy to that end, either as an employee or co-founder of a new venture.

### Highlights:

 - Taught arduino classes around the country at maker spaces, developed original curriculum, including specialized hardware
 - Brought the Shot Noise Thermometer from a concept to a deployed technology used around the world, starting with research as a technician in Shoelkopf’s lab, then as a grad student, then as a post doc at NIST, then as a consultant at APL.  Over an 18 year arc I have guided this technology, which has found significant use for calibrating the noise in quantum measurement systems as well as precision temperature measurement.  Won award for best engineering dissertation, multiple invited talks, published in Science, invited by South Korean government(KRISS) in 2012 to help deploy the technology in their standards lab.
 - Developed the lumped element microwave SQUID amplifier, leveraging NIST’s existing SQUID fab and design to make ultra low noise amplifiers used in readout for quantum systems in labs both inside and outside NIST(Princeton, Dartmouth). - Developed the fully open source Geometron geometric programming language and published in a book available at [https://www.trashrobot.org](https://www.trashrobot.org)
 - Was on the board of Concoctory maker space briefly in 2014
 - Worked as a teaching assistant in graduate school building new electromaginetic demonstrations from scratch and bringing old demos back from the grave 
 - Volunteered at Upcycle Alexandria, teaching kids about electronics and robotics
 - Mentored interns who built microscopes from electronic trash and won a science fair and wrote a paper 
 - Raised approximately 1 million dollars in grants while working at NIST, was PI on two grants
 - Have led successful crowdfund campaigns of open source hardware products
 - Black belt in judo, experienced teaching adult judo
 - Raised about a million dollars in DoD funding(NSA and ONR), managed multiple projects as PI on Josephson junction projects at NIST. Filed monthly reports to sponsors, attended program reviews, managed sponsor relationships.
 - Founded, built and managed startup company of 10 people, interfacing with investors, partners, contractors, customers and the media to build a several hundred thousand dollar a year operation from scratch. Raised 250k in investor capital, managed investor relations.
 - Managed and mentored post docs and grad students at NIST
 - President of Yale cleanroom for 1 year, managed both equipment and personalities to keep things running smoothly from changing oil on vacuum pumps to smoothing over disputes over equipment scheduling

### WORK HISTORY: 

#### Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Senior Staff scientist, 2019-present.  

In addition to research duties(which I can't discuss), worked on STEM education both for high school and adult ages. created the Arduino curriculum for the maker space.  Created a system for internal self-replicating web pages which can be shared across a local network, published an internal paper about it.  Mentored high school interns building microscopes from electronic waste(DVD drives), doing electrochemical measurements with Arduino, and interacting with quantum information using web browser based software.
